# Chimera Client

Chimera Client is a modular utility client for Minecraft Java edition that allows you to customize your gameplay with various hacks and modules. It is mainly focused on extensibility. 

## Features

Be warned, this client is still in *very* early development.
Currently, we have
 1. KillAura
 2. Fly
 3. Dependency-based (unbenchmarked) EventSystem
 4. Simple GUI. 

## Installation

Later on, we'll start adding releases to github releases, but for now, please clone and build the repo yourself.
Alternatively, you can try to get the build artifacts from github actions.
